# Installing and Using Kubernetes on DC/OS

In this first part of the tutorial, [**Getting Started with Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise**](/getting-started/), you will learn the basics of how to:

  - setup a DC/OS Enterprise cluster able to connect with Kubernetes
  - install the Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine (MKE) on your DC/OS cluster
  - create two Kubernetes clusters on top of your DC/OS cluster with using the DC/OS Kubernetes CLI

This will provide you with a thorough, but basic, Enterprise installation of DC/OS Kubernetes. For more detailed installation instructions, or to find out how to further customize your installation of DC/OS Kubernetes, see the [Customizing](/services/kubernetes/THIS_VERSION/operations/customizing-install/) section.

# Next: Setting up your DC/OS Enterprise cluster for Kubernetes

[Next, we will setup our DC/OS Enterprise cluster](/services/kubernetes/THIS_VERSION/getting-started/provision-install/setting-up/) as the first step in this part of [**Getting Started with Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise**](/services/kubernetes/THIS_VERSION/getting-started/). This will ensure a successful demonstration of operating Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise.

You can skip to another part using the cards below or move on to the [next step in this section clicking here](/services/kubernetes/THIS_VERSION/getting-started/provision-install/setting-up/).
